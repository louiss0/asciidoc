# Asciidoc Astro Lab

This repository is a place where Asciidoc code can be prepared for Astro.
This repo provides `vitest` for testing. It installs `asciidoctor`
for Asciidoc. It uses `biome` for linting. It's package manager is `pnpm`.

The testing files are placed under the `tests/` folder. +
The language reference guide is placed under `LANG-REFERENCE.adoc`. +
Posts are placed in `src/posts`. +

I decided to style the intro page using UnoCSS.
